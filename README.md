This is the oldest code I've ever written that I could find. It's a Turbo Pascal library written from scratch in assembler to support fast drawing operations in mode 13h. It has functions to draw basic shapes, to display sprites, etc. It comes with a "IRC fast comp" written over a weekend with 2D metaballs that form letters.

I had been writing code as a hobby for 2 years at that point.
